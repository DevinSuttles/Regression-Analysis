## How does it work?
## Room for improvement
- The types of regression lines can easily be expanded, incorporating power or logarithmic lines for example.
- It might be possible to generalize all polynomial regression lines using gradient descent to find the minimum sum of squared residuals instead of calculating the coefficients for each one out by hand.
